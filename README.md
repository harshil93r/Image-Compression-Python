===================


Stuck in a situation where you need to render different resolution of same image. This will solve that problem.

Run the app by `python image_compression_app.py` it will be served onn the port 8080 by default.

Serve any image in that folder by using URL :

 - localhost:8080/images/{imageName} `?comresrred=true&res={resPercentage}`
